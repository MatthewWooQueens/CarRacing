# How to Run
Run every cell in from top to bottom until the final 2 cells. <br />
The first main function contains the model training. <br />
The second main function contains the inference for running the model, which requires a pth file. <br />
The pth file is stored in ./checkpoints/raceNet/ and will be labeled based on the number training episodes run. <br />
The pth file will have to be renamed to 'raceNet.pth' and pulled outside the checkpoint directory. <br />
